        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <em>"It looks just like a magic newspaper in <abbr title="Harry Potter">H.P.</abbr><del>(Lovecraft)</del>" </em>
            <p>This was the first thought that hit me the moment I tried to understand web development.<br> 
                It was a dream come true.
            </p>
            <h3>I am NO investor.</h3>
            <p>
                Spent 4 years learning to become an Industrial Designer,<br>
                only to discover nobody needs Industrial Design in my hometown,<br>
                so I turned my aspiration to Web Design,<br>
                desiring a unique position in this brutal industry.<br>
                Not for too long, other designers joined this field,<br>
                Although Iâ€™m no longer special, at least I can still be a pioneer.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Then the AI came, and I lost the gambit, again. </h3>
            <p>
                People like to ask me why I chose IMD, and my true answer is here:<br>
                I'm eager for a reason to keep doing design,<br>
                in this world where everyone around me is trying to convince me that designers are useless.<br>
                This is my happily brief biography, hope you have a nice day,<br>
                and sorry that I am not an optimistic little student who has no idea about design,<br>
                but a desperate worker with countless undelightful experiences.<br>
                I need hope, and I want to find one in Algonquin College.

        <h2>About the quote</h2>
        <div>
            <p>my most faiverate quote is in a movie Oppenheimer,<br> when he stood up on the mountaion and said:</p>
                <div id="img">
                    <p><cite>"It's Oppen-time"</cite><blockquote>--(Oppenheimer, 2023)</blockquote></p>
                    <img id="oppen" src="oppen.jpg"/>
                </div>
            <p>no it is just meme, don't get too serious. Thank you~ </p>
